Game Title (Working Name): Find & Match Adventure!

🎯 Overview
Find & Match Adventure is a fun, kid-friendly web game where children explore a colorful, detailed image and try to find specific hidden objects. The goal is to help kids improve visual recognition, focus, and memory through engaging gameplay and rewarding feedback.

🕹️ Core Gameplay
* The game screen is divided into two sections:
    * Left Panel (Main Scene): A large, detailed image containing multiple hidden objects (e.g., a jungle, a beach, a city scene).
    * Right Panel (Target Object): Displays a smaller image of one object that the player must find within the larger scene.
* The player clicks or taps on the location of the target object in the main scene.
    * If correct, the object is highlighted, and the player earns +1 point.
    * A short sound effect or animation confirms the success (e.g., sparkle or cheer).
    * A new target object then appears for the next round.
* The game continues until all target objects are found.
    * When completed, a celebratory animation or message (e.g., “Great job! You found them all!”) appears, and the total score is displayed.
